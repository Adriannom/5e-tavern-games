# Wyvern
Wyvern is a popular card game using a special set of cards, commonly available. There are no dice involved in Wyvern, but you and your players will roll dice to determine the outcome of the game. One player is the Wyvern and the rest the heroes. The Wyvern's deck is full of monsters and dark magic, while the heroes' deck is full of goodly creatures and righteous magic. You can encourage players to improv some cards they lay down as part of the exchange to spice things up.

## Setup
- Decide who the Wyvern is. This could be random, or maybe some kind of etiquette or privilege.
- Agree on a set amount for each bet.

## Gameplay

### Ante Up
- Ante the set amount.
- Each player rolls d20 in secret.
- The Wyvern decides whether to attack or retreat. If they attack, they bet a further three times the set amount, if they retreat, the Wyvern is out of the round.
- If the Wyvern attacked, the heroes must, in clockwise order to the left of the Wyvern, match the bet or be slain (out of the round).
- If the Wyvern retreated, the heroes move onto the next step.

### Cheating
- Starting with the Wyvern, or the next surviving hero to the left, characters may decide to cheat.
- If a character cheats they make a sleight of hand check against the passive perception of any observers. If they succeed, they may roll an extra d20 and add it to their secret roll. If they fail they are caught cheating!
- After a player cheats, they gain one point of suspicion. Suspicion is added to observer's passive perception when that player cheats again. At the DM's discretion you may start a subsequent game with a higher suspicion if observers have witnessed you cheating before (whether you were caught or not).

Magic can be used to aid or detect cheating. Normally magic with verbal and somatic components are very obvious when cast. If magic is employed then the relevant cheater(s) gain advantage or disadvantage on their roll, whichever is appropriate.

### Reveal
- Reveal your dice and add your intelligence modifier plus gambling proficiency to the roll.
- Whoever gets the highest total wins the pot.
- The mantle of Wyvern passes to the left and the next round begins.

Players can join in the game or drop out at the end of any round. If someone joins a running game then they must sit to the right of the current Wyvern.
