# Big Pig
This one doesn't include too much room for roleplaying, but it can be tense, so try to use that by attaching very high stakes to the game for ultimate suspense! Players take turns throwing small model pigs (or dice) in a push-your-luck game of chance.

## Setup
- Each player starts on zero points.
- Decide a starting player. This could be random, or it could be the last player to touch a real pig, for example.

## Gameplay
- Roll 2d6 and add the numbers together.
- If two 1s are rolled, add 25 to your turn score.
- If a different double is rolled, add twice the value to your turn score.
- If a 1 is showing on only one of the dice, you lose your turn score and your turn is over.
- Decide whether to repeat this process, adding to your turn score, or "hold" and add your turn score to your points total and end your turn.
- If you're proficient in the gambling skill, add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the turn score when you hold.
- After your turn play passes to the left.

## Winning
A player wins immediately when they hold and they have 100 points or more.

## Cheating
It's hard to cheat in this game without magic. If you fail a cheating roll then you are caught! The DM may of course apply advantage or disadvantage on your roll based on circumstance at their discretion.

### Suspicion
After each time a player cheats, they gain one point of suspicion. Suspicion usually starts at zero and is added to DC of cheating rolls. At the DM's discretion you may start a subsequent game with a suspicion higher than zero if the same observers have witnessed you when you were cheating in any game before (whether you were caught or not).

### Misdirection
Will probably only work with a very gullible opponent who will fall for tricks like "Look behind you! Oh look I rolled a double six while you weren't looking!". Automatically fails unless the DM decides that there is a compelling reason for the ruse to work. In those circumstances, roll deception vs passive insight of observers. Success means you can change the face of one die to any other face.

### Weighted Pigs
For this you need two identical sets of pigs/dice (or similar, but roll with disadvantage). Roll sleight of hand vs passive perception of observers to successfully swap the dice. While weighted, any player who rolls may roll twice and pick the better result. You must roll again to swap the dice back, and it counts as another instance of cheating, so you gain another point of suspicion.

### Magic
Remember that many spells require somatic and verbal components and so may not be possible to do covertly.
