# 5e Tavern Games

The intention of this project is to create a collection of games that would be interesting to use in a D&D session. The games must:

- Be interesting to all players at the table, or short enough that it doesn't matter.
- Allow anyone with proficiency in gambling to get an advantage.
- Have guidelines for how cheating affects the game, because as you know your players are a bunch of rascals.

I welcome bug reports, suggestions, pull requests and forks.

Happy gaming,

Adriannom.
